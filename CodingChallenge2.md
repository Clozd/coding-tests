# Coding Challenge 2
## Scenario
Now, users have realized that every company is different. They each care about different employee information. For example, some companies want to store "birth date" for each employee while others want to store "average daily weight of snacks consumed" for each employee.

This will be tricky with the current data structure because each employee field (name, avatar, title, country) are each a separate column. If company 1 wants to store "number of trips to Canada" and company 2 wants to store "has broken a bone?", that would eventually lead to a lot of different columns that are mostly empty.

There has to be a better way to make custom employee fields on a company basis.

> Note: You do not need to support multiple data types for this task. The values can be entered, stored, and displayed as text.

## Already Built
- [x] Coding Challenge 1 should already be complete. If you haven't already completed it, you will have to do that as part of this coding challenge.

## Requirements
- [ ] Somewhere in the UI, a user should be able to add a new custom empoyee field for a particular company.
- [ ] Somewhere in the UI, a user should be able to populate the values for the fields for a given employee in that company.
- [ ] Display any new custom employee field next to each employee on the single company page.
